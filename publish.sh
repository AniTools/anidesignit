# Publishes your latest changes (CMS edits, code, anything) to the live site.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Shows you exactly what changed — added, edited, and deleted files
#   2. Asks you to confirm before doing anything
#   3. Commits everything with a message (today's date by default, or your own)
#   4. Pushes to GitHub, which tells Netlify to rebuild the live site
#
# Usage:
#   ./publish.sh                        (uses today's date as the message)
#   ./publish.sh "Added new project"    (your own message)
